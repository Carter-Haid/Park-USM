<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The campus parking project began as an Advanced Python Programming course assignemnt at the University of Southern Maine. At the time many students were frusturated with the communication from the university about what lots were closed during snow storms or large campus events. The lack of communication led to many students cars being ticketed, booted, or even towed. 

Why Campus Parking Project Works:
* Shows which lots are closed using an easy to visualize map. 
* Can inform students of city/town parking bans so they will know to avoid street parking. 
* Integrates with any campus alert system for real time closure information via text.

Of course, no solution can ever be perfect. That's why the Campus Parking Project continues to add additional features, make changes, and fix bugs to give the user the best experience possible. 

If you'd like to be part of the free beta and try Campus Parking Project for your business, city, or company please reach out using the information provided in the contact section below.
